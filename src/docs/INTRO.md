### Full-stack web developer.

#### 20+ years in startup and corporate environments (WebMD, Rakuten)

I specialize in building web front-end applications (Next.js/React.js/Node.js/Express) with production experience in MongoDB, Redis, Docker, AWS and more out of **Vancouver, Canada**.

TL;DR: I build custom websites that scale using modern technology from start to finish or as a part of a team.

Meta: [See the code I used to build this page on GitHub](https://github.com/dmitrizzle/dev).
