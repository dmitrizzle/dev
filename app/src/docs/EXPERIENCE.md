### Work experience.

Please note that I’ve arranged my experience in order of relevance. Below, you’ll find my [entrepreneurial roles](#founding-roles), [open-source contributions](#open-source), and [education summary](#education).

#### **WebMD** 2019-2024

**Senior Software Engineer.** Remote/Vancouver.

After my [exit](https://www.qxmd.com/webmd-acquires-qxmd) with QxMD, I continued my role at WebMD with integration and compliance responsibilities on the same stack but with more diverse APIs, codebases, management software, and stakeholders.

#### **QxMD** 2018-2019

**Senior Software Engineer.** Vancouver.

[QxMD](https://www.qxmd.com/) (now part of [Medscape](https://www.medscape.com/)/[WebMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebMD)) served medical professionals with interactive tools, a learning portal, and a scientific journal registry. I was the first full-time front-end engineer responsible for rewriting all the web applications and associated components.

In my first year, I transformed the company’s two main ten-year-old Perl/PHP/CSS/JQuery codebases into fast, SEO-friendly Next.js applications structured for easy readability and safe deployments with good unit and integration test coverage (various CI tech, from GitHub Actions to Jenkins to GitLab) and TypeScript.

Later the same year, I took over the Node.js/Pug project (learning portal) with TypeForm integration and rewrote it in React.js. My side quest was to build a JavaScript package for collecting and transmitting user interaction events in full compliance with GDPR.

By the end of my first year, [QxMD was sold to WebMD](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/internet-brands-webmd-acquires-qxmd-300898932.html). As a part of the founding team, I got to exercise my options.

#### **Kobo Inc. (Rakuten)** 2012-2013

**Web Producer.** Toronto.

[Kobo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobo_Inc.) is a Canadian e-reader and a bookseller that’s now owned by a Japanese retail giant. I built accessible and widely compatible email templates (which was very difficult at the time due to the email clients’ archaic rendering engines) and responsive microsites (vanilla HTML, SASS, & vanilla JavaScript) using the best practices of the time.

#### **Henning Solutions** 2009-2011

**Web Developer and Art Director.** Toronto.

Henning Solutions was a software engineering firm that built e-commerce websites and a video streaming service for children. I built various web components in PHP (and limited ASP.NET) with front-ends made with MooTools and SASS.

I also created and produced [animated shorts](https://vimeo.com/31818723) in AfterEffects and Pro Tools (for audio production).

### Founding roles.

I worked in a variety of capacities as a founder of three Canadian and one US-based businesses. This section summarizes a few highlights from this journey.

#### **Analog.Cafe** 2017-now

**Founding Editor and Engineer.** Chiang Mai/Vancouver.

[Analog.Cafe](https://www.analog.cafe) is a Canadian web publishing/content platform with a custom CMS built mainly in Node/Next.js and a visual editor made with Slate.js. It uses MongoDB/Redis for content storage and user accounts/actions and integrates with Sendgrid and Cloudinary. It uses Passport.js for SSO and one-time-code authentication.

Analog.Cafe is a blog with public contributions (100+ authors). It has a growing readership of 100K UMV, 13K email subscribers, and 100 monthly paid subscribers via Stripe.

I built many types of [tools and apps](https://www.analog.cafe/apps-downloads) for Analog.Cafe. I am currently working on an app that sources large image files from connected Dropbox accounts in real time and processes them in queued Kubernetes pods on DigitalOcean.

#### **Eureka King** 2015-2018

**CTO.** San Francisco/Chiang Mai.

Eureka King was a US-based startup that served journalist organizations (Associated Press, KQED) and the public with web-based marketing tools and analytics dashboards. I designed and built front-end components with Ruby on Rails, Cake/PHP, React.js, and Node.js.

My less technical responsibilities included hiring and managing a team of three full-time developers, coordinating interns, and various startup duties.

#### **Hechnr Business Engines Inc.** 2013-2014

**Technical Co-Founder.** Toronto.

HBE was a Canadian startup that designed iPhone applications. As a co-founder, I designed various components of an iPhone application and helped get the seed round funding.

### Open-source.

I’ve contributed to a number of projects on GitHub. Below is my most-used open-source project:

#### **`chat-bubble`**

**Core maintainer.**

[`chat-bubble`](https://github.com/dmitrizzle/chat-bubble) is a simple vanilla JavaScript framework for building chat front-ends on the web quickly and with minimal setup. It was made to simplify bot interactions and had numerous contributions, including RASA implementation. While this project has been dormant since 2021, it has zero dependencies and thus needs no chore updates.
