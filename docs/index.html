<h4><strong>WebMD</strong> 2019-2024</h4>
<p><strong>Senior Software Engineer.</strong> Remote/Vancouver.</p>
<p>After my <a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.qxmd.com/webmd-acquires-qxmd">exit</a> with QxMD, I continued my role at WebMD with integration and compliance responsibilities on the same stack but with more diverse APIs, codebases, management software, and stakeholders.</p>
<h4><strong>QxMD</strong> 2018-2019</h4>
<p><strong>Senior Software Engineer.</strong> Vancouver.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.qxmd.com/">QxMD</a> (now part of <a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.medscape.com/">Medscape</a>/<a target="_blank" class="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebMD">WebMD</a>) served medical professionals with interactive tools, a learning portal, and a scientific journal registry. I was the first full-time front-end engineer responsible for rewriting all the web applications and associated components.</p>
<p>In my first year, I transformed the company’s two main ten-year-old Perl/PHP/CSS/JQuery codebases into fast, SEO-friendly Next.js applications structured for easy readability and safe deployments with good unit and integration test coverage (various CI tech, from GitHub Actions to Jenkins to GitLab) and TypeScript.</p>
<p>Later the same year, I took over the Node.js/Pug project (learning portal) with TypeForm integration and rewrote it in React.js. My side quest was to build a JavaScript package for collecting and transmitting user interaction events in full compliance with GDPR.</p>
<p>By the end of my first year, <a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/internet-brands-webmd-acquires-qxmd-300898932.html">QxMD was sold to WebMD</a>. As a part of the founding team, I got to exercise my options.</p>
<h4><strong>Kobo Inc. (Rakuten)</strong> 2012-2013</h4>
<p><strong>Web Producer.</strong> Toronto.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" class="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobo_Inc.">Kobo</a> is a Canadian e-reader and a bookseller that’s now owned by a Japanese retail giant. I built accessible and widely compatible email templates (which was very difficult at the time due to the email clients’ archaic rendering engines) and responsive microsites (vanilla HTML, SASS, &amp; vanilla JavaScript) using the best practices of the time.</p>
<h4><strong>Henning Solutions</strong> 2009-2011</h4>
<p><strong>Web Developer and Art Director.</strong> Toronto.</p>
<p>Henning Solutions was a software engineering firm that built e-commerce websites and a video streaming service for children. I engineered various web components in PHP (and limited ASP.NET) with front-ends made with MooTools and SASS.

<p>Analog.Cafe is a blog with public contributions (100+ authors). It has a growing readership of 100K UMV, 14K email subscribers, and hundreds of paying customers via Stripe.</p>
<p>I built many types of <a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.analog.cafe/apps-downloads">tools and apps</a> to extend the website’s functionality. The most capable is a K8S deployment with autoscaling via Keda and an in-house queue management with MongoDB written in Typescript. This deployment uses <code>libvips</code>, <code>sharp</code>, <code>libraw</code>, and Dropbox API via Node.js (written with TypeScript) to <a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.analog.cafe/app/film-q">batch-invert film negatives</a> (typically large image files, up to 300 MiB) in the cloud.</p>
